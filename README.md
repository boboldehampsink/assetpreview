DEPRECATED - Asset Preview plugin for Craft CMS Control Panel
=================

Plugin that allows you to preview image assets in the CP.

Features:
 - Select an asset and hit __space__ to preview
 - Uses [FancyBox v2](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/) for previewing

Important:
The plugin's folder should be named "assetpreview"

Deprecated
=================

With the release of Craft 3 on 4-4-2018, this plugin has been deprecated. You can still use this with Craft 2 but you are encouraged to use (and develop) a Craft 3 version. At this moment, I have no plans to do so.
